# Quick post mortem

This was my first Ludum Dare and first serious game jam game. I am pretty happy with
the idea and gameplay mechanics but execution wasn't up to my stardards. I got feedback
that generally mentioned it took some time to figure out how to play the game and
I understand that completely. The user experience side wasn't developed nearly enough
due to time constraints. I was too focused on getting everything to work within the deadline.

The codebase is also a huge mess of bad and undocumented code. I was going to refactor it and
create proper well written code but decided against it. I've taken the main mechanic from this 
game and started working on a new game from scratch.

Overall I'm happy I took part in LD42 and I learned a lot chatting with other participants. I'm
already looking forward to LD43.
